Here are some bigger TODO's that should be addressed sooner or later.

# Support metadata fetching from OAI

http://www.openarchives.org/

# Live Nepomuk completer

Currently the auto completion wastes a lot of resources by creating huge lookup table for
all valid resources of a specific type. This leads to ~12+ query clients that observe
changes in the nepomuk storage to update the completer and fails horrible when a resource 
is renamed.

Solution: Create a new KCompleter or KLineEdit that does a live sparql search (like the krunner does)



######################################
# support more online storages

 Like zotero there does exist more storages we could sync with

* mendeley     : http://apidocs.mendeley.com/home/user-specific-methods
* researchgate : if even possible?
* refbase
* ownCloud     : Someone needs to write the server side for this first

and possible others I'm not aware of currently



######################################
# KDE integration

make other KDE programs aware of nepomuk and the bib information

* okular         : could fetch info and show links to related publications on the disk
* calligra Words : insert citation / create reference list at the end
* ...



######################################
# Intelligent parsing

Parse pdf documents and find more information
* metadata extraction of title, author, doi etc
* parse the fulltext content for cited documents and add them to nepomuk (with the links)
* auto-magically find the right publication information on the internet/nepomuk when we just have the pdf
* keyword extraction for any documents
* ...



######################################
# Nepomuk DMS integration

switch from the plain Nepomuk::Resource approach to the SimpleResource and SimpleResourceGraph 
this helps to avoid duplicates and so on



######################################
# Better akonadi integration

Needs the todo above. Create edit/ contacts/events in akonadi with the right tools rather than in nepomuk 
directly. Currently resource merging after we pushed a resource into akonadi fails.
and I can't push events into akonadi



######################################
# Browser integration

Like zoteros page translators create plugins that push data directly from any browser into nepomuk
There exist a python system for rekonq already just needs proper integration



######################################
# more todos are in the doxygen docu
