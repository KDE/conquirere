/**
  * @brief A Library is a collection of files and Nepomuk::Resource data of a specific topic
  *
  * The Library can be either a @c System @c library containing all known entities or a specific
  * library containing only a subset of the system entities grouped together for a
  * specific topic.
  *
  * The Library fulfils the task of organizing all necessary resource parts.
  *
  * For specific libraries the creation of the corresponding folder structure,
  * the creation of a pimo:Project resource and creation of a settings file is done by this class
  *
  * Also the possibility to relate resources from the system library is the
  * responsibility of this class.
  *
  * For all libraries the necessary model data used in connected views
  * are handled by this class.
  *
  * Usually a new unique System Library is created on the start of the program.
  * Additional librarys will be created/loaded/closed/deleted on request.
