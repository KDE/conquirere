/**
  * @brief Base class to sync nepomuk data with the Zotero online service
  *
  * This class combines the ReadFromZotero and WriteToZotero and organize the merging between these steps.
  * When some data on the server side changes and the mergemode is set to Manual the signal userMerge() is emitted
  * Any gui that calls this class need to show a gui and resolve the issues before this class can continue
  * When the merge is solved the slot mergeFinished() must be called to continue the process
  *
  * Same applies for deleting items, when the user interaction is requested the signal askForDeletion() is emitted
  * and the slot deleteLocalFiles() must be called when the selection was made.
  *
  * The current progress can be shown via progress() and progressStatus()
  *
  * Two different sync cases must be handeled in here
  * @li syncing with the base zotero collection (all items regardless of their groups)
  * @li syncing with a specific group
  *
  * The 2nd case together with the snc of a project Library instead the full system Library changes the way
  * the sync merging/removing/addition is done.
  *
  * Here we add the pimo:isRelated to any new item retrieved from the server and
  * remove this relation when an item should be deleted (while the item will still exist in the system library)
  *
  * This means in return, that a local project represents 1 group on the Zotero server.
  *
  * Another special case:
  * We removed the publication/reference from a library project and need to remove them on the server side too.
  *
  * They way to find such a case follows the following concept:
  * Any reference/publication that is synced with a storage has it @c sync:ServerSyncData when the reference/publication is deleted
  * by conquirere or any other program the @c sync:ServerSyncData is still there but without a valid reference/publication
  *
  * Now when we download data from te hserver and check for teh duplicates, we find the @c sync:ServerSyncData and see that the ref/pub was deleted
  * We know now teh user wanted to delete it (remove it from teh group) and we do not import this entyr again. Instead we
  * will delete it from the server side as soon as the next upload happens.

      *     If the etag values do not match we need to merge the online and local item and store them for this purpose in @p mergeRequest
