This file should give a really smal overview how all the stuff is connected

Folders:
nbib     	=> bibtex ontology for nepomuk
src      	=> source code ;)
+ 
+- core  	=> all stuff not connected to a gui element
|
+-+ ui    	=> all the ui stuff
  |
  +-documents	=> all widgets to show and manipulate document informations
  |
  +- project	=> all widgets to show project files
  |
  +- semantic	=> Set of general widgets to easily manipulate nupomuk meta data
                   for example a new QLineEdit class etc.

Function:
The idea is, that nepomuk does all the work.
This program creates a nepomuk tag and some folder structure.
All the data can but don't have to be placed in the project folder

Strigi/Nepomuk collect all data outside the project fodler and make them available

Conquierer is only used to manipulate metadata and collection handling
Also it allows to start external programs to work with the data itself
*Okular for pdf files
*Kmail for mails
*Konquerer for bookmarks
 and so on
maybe someday everything will be imbedded via kparts into one program
